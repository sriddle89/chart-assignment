<h1> Two Schools Under One Roof: A Tale of Segregation in NYC </h1>
<h2> By Safiyah Riddle
  </section>
<div class="body">
  <section class="lede paragraph">
<p>Two public elementary schools have shared a building for decades, but that appears to be where the commonalities end. Five years after Manhattan’s School District 1 pioneered an integration plan for its highly segregated public elementary schools, using a $1.25 million state grant, the socioeconomic demographics of the two schools remain largely unchanged.
</p>
<p>Ninety-one percent of the students enrolled at P.S. 64 come from families living at or below the poverty line, as measured by qualification for free school lunch. Across the hall, 55% of the students enrolled at the Earth School are at or below the poverty line. Somewhere in the middle is the district wide rate of poverty, at around 65%. There are comparable racial disparities between the schools, with P.S. 64 almost homogeneously Latinx and Black, and the Earth School disproportionately white, but slightly closer to districtwide levels. </p>

<section class="second paragraph"
 <p> These two schools characterize a district-wide split. The Earth School – like the Children’s Workshop, the Neighborhood School, and the East Village Community School in District 1 – is considered “progressive” because the curriculum avoids traditional elements of schooling. There is little to no homework and testing, de-emphasis on rote memorization, the teachers that go by first names.
  </p>
 <p> These are also the four whitest schools in the district. The schools that are considered more traditional – typically defined by emphasis on standardized testing – are almost homogeneously Black and Latinx.</p>
<p> There is a material dimension to the separation as well. Although New York’s Fair Funding Law means that P.S. 64 receives more government funding than the Earth School, in 2019, P.S. 64 fundraised $5,012 from parents and donations – amounting to $25.62 per student. In the same year, the Earth School fundraised $116,000 – or, $331.43 per student.

 <p>As superintendents across the city deliberate on whether to reinstate competitive entrance exams and expand Gifted and Talented programs, the perennial debate over school segregation has once returned to the forefront of public discourse. However, there are no tests or interviews to get into the Earth School or P.S. 64, and neither have Gifted and Talented Programs.
</p>
<p> In 2017, District 1 elected officials and activists won a $1.25 million state-funded grant to implement an integration plan targeted parents' choice as a way to address divisions.
</p>
<p>There were two main elements to the plan. First, participating schools agreed to allot 61 percent of seats for students with high economic need: in other words, students that qualify for free or reduced lunch, those living in temporary housing, and English language learners. Second, the plan established a Family Resource Center, housed in P.S. 20, which sought to improve access to information about a wide range of schools in the district. </p>
<p> Although the Earth School is not far off of the 61 percent target for high economic need, the disparity between the two schools, and schools districtwide, has hardly budged since the plan was first implemented.</p>

<p>According to Amy Wells, a professor at the Columbia Teachers College who was part of the coalition formed by the Department of Education to craft the District 1 integration plan, “the pandemic introduced a lot of variables that make the success of the plan hard to evaluate.”

</p>
<p> One potential complicating variable, Wells said, is a widespread drop in the enrollment of white students at public schools.
</p>
<p>While the 10% drop in white students at the Earth School since might initially suggest some improvements in diversity, there hasn’t been a commensurate increase in non-white students. While 2021 had 42 less white students than 2017, there were only five additional Hispanic students, one additional Asian student, and seven fewer Black students over the same time period.
